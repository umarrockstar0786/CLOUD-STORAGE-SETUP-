"DESCRIPTION": Internship Task - 1: Cloud Storage Setup

As part of the CODTECH internship, Task 1 involves setting up and configuring cloud storage using either Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This is a practical task designed to help interns understand how to work with cloud platforms to store, manage, and share data securely and efficiently.

The main objective of this task is to create a cloud storage bucket, upload sample files, and configure appropriate access permissions to ensure secure and managed access to the data. Interns can choose either AWS or GCP based on their preference or experience.

Using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and terminal commands or cloud SDKs (like AWS CLI or Google Cloud CLI), interns will:

Create a new bucket (unique name and region-specific).

Upload example files such as images, documents, or code files.

Set bucket permissions (private/public or user-defined access).

Generate a shareable link or access policy for the files.


This task helps interns learn about:

Cloud storage architecture

Data access policies

File upload automation

Cloud CLI or SDK usage

Real-world cloud project deployment basics


Upon completion, the configured cloud bucket with uploaded files and access settings serves as the project deliverable. This task builds a strong foundation in cloud technologies and prepares interns for future cloud-based development or DevOps roles.
